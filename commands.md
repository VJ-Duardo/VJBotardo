### Braille Art ("ascii")

All the braille commands support the following options:  

* __-h__ \<number\>  
Sets the height of the ascii in pixels. One character consists of 2x4 pixels.
  
* __-w__ \<number\>  
Sets the width of the ascii in pixels.
 
* __-r__ \<number\>  
Rotates the ascii given degrees.
  
* __-tr__ \<number\>  
If set, static threshold dithering with the given number (between 0 and 255) will be used to generate the ascii. Generally, a higher value leads to a darker picture, while a lower value leads to a brighter one.
  
* __-d__  
If this option is present, the ascii will be generated using the Floyd-Steinberg-Algorithm.

* __-i__  
The end result will be inverted using this option.

* __-t__ \<text\>  
This option should always be set last, since everything written after the *-t* will be used as text and printed on the ascii.

Example: *__!ascii forsenE -w 50 -h 52 -r 180__*  
Example2: *__!ascii DatSheffy -tr 255 -t Who's that pokemon?__*
